# Chat-room
To run this code correctly you need Python 3.x installed, as well as PySide2 library. You need to have all 3 files (server.py, main.py and client.py) in the same folder and by running main.py file you run whole chat room, as it opens both server side and client side. It runs on 'localhost' but it is possible to change that. <br />
It is also possible to add more clients as it is shown in main.py file in commented lines. <br />
